A youtube-dl wrapper - RainDrop was originally a standalone program, but youtube-dl did so much more I ended up just wrapping it.

RainDrop is a simple Youtube/Soundcloud Audio Downloader written in C# by DarkTussin

This version wraps Youtube-DL providing additional functionality.

To Use: 

1. Select a "Bucket" (Folder) to save the "RainDrops" (Audio Files) to.
2. Enter Content in the top Textbox:
   
   a. Enter a Youtube/Soundcloud Link (contains /watch?v=)
   b. Enter a Playlist Link (contains /playlist?list=)
   c. Enter a song/playlist search (Example: pink floyd comfortably numb or ukf dubstep playlist 2014)

3. Click "Make it Rain" (Download)  to start downloading the files.

(Note: If a playlist is detected, it will automatically pull the links)

Raindrops that "Failed to Condense" (Failed to Download) will "Evaporate" (Close)

To Cancel a Download simply close the associated RainDrop.

To Cancel all Downloads simply close the main form.

(If songs are downloading, it will abort them - click again to close all the way).

Songs with HQ Resolutions will typically contain higher quality audio.
